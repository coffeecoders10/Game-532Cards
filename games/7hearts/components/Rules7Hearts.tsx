      <li>
        <strong>Three to five players, seven rounds.</strong> Get rid of your cards first and keep your penalty points as
        low as you can. Lowest total after round seven wins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The deal.</strong> The full 52-card deck is dealt out, as evenly as it will go. Nobody sees anyone
        else&apos;s cards, and there is no draw pile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The opening.</strong> Whoever holds the 7 of Hearts starts the round by playing it. Play then goes
        clockwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Playing a card.</strong> Open a new suit by playing its 7, or extend a suit already on the table one
        step down or one step up: if the 7 and 8 of a suit are out, the 6 and the 9 are next.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ace is low, King is high.</strong> Every suit runs Ace, 2, 3 up to Queen, King. The run does not wrap
        around.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Passing.</strong> If none of your cards fit, you pass. If any card of yours fits, you have to play one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ending a round.</strong> The first player to play their last card goes out and takes no points. Everyone
        else takes the value of the cards they still hold: Ace is 1, face cards are 11, 12 and 13.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Winning.</strong> Points add up across the seven rounds. The lowest total wins.
