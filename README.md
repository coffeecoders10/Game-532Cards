# CC Card Games

A hub of playing-card games for the browser. Currently: **5-3-2**, a three-player trick-taking game, and **7-8**, a two-player one. The shared look and feel, and how to add a game, are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

Built with Next.js (App Router), plain CSS Modules, and the shared Socket.IO room service described in [docs/sop-socket.md](docs/sop-socket.md).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # must be served from http://localhost:3000 (the socket service's allowed origin)
```

Pick 5-3-2 on the hub, open a table, send the six-character code (or the invite link) to two friends, and deal.

## How it plays

30 cards: 8 to Ace in four suits, plus the 7 of spades and 7 of hearts. Each round has 10 hands and the three players carry targets of 5, 3 and 2 hands.

1. Everyone gets 5 cards; the player holding the **5** picks trump, then everyone gets 5 more.
2. From round 2, anyone who **won more than their target** trades with anyone who **fell short**, one trade per hand of difference. The taker draws a random card from the other player's hand, sees it, then gives back any card of their own.
3. The 5 leads. Follow suit if you can; highest trump wins, otherwise highest card of the led suit. The winner leads next.
4. After the round the targets rotate: 5 becomes 2, 3 becomes 5, 2 becomes 3. Rounds continue until you stop.

## How 7-8 plays

Same 30-card deck, two players. The **8** wants 8 of the 15 hands, the **7** wants 7, and the roles trade places after every deal.

1. Each player gets 5 cards in hand; the 8 picks trump, then everyone gets five face-down cards with a face-up card on top of each.
2. Play from your hand or any face-up table card; playing a table card flips the card beneath. Follow suit across both. The 8 leads the first hand, winners lead after.
3. Win more than your number and you earn a swap per extra hand: next deal you take either a chosen face-up card or a random hand card from the other player, and give one of yours back.
4. Deals continue until players leave.

## Code layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Routes: `/` (the hub), `/games/532` (5-3-2 landing) and `/games/532/room/[code]` (a table). |
| `games/registry.tsx` | The list of games shown on the hub. Add an entry to add a tile. |
| `games/532/game/` | Pure 5-3-2 rules (`engine.ts`), deck (`deck.ts`), and the per-player view projection (`view.ts`). No React, no networking. |
| `games/532/net/`, `games/78/net/` | Each game's actions (`protocol.ts`) and its adapter (`table.ts`) that plugs its rules into the shared sessions. |
| `games/78/` | 7-8: same layout as 5-3-2 (`game/` rules and view, `net/`, `components/`). |
| `lib/net/` | Shared multiplayer: `host.ts` and `guest.ts` sessions, `crypto.ts`, `room.ts` (Socket.IO transport), `wire.ts`, `storage.ts` and the `useTable` hook. |
| `components/table/` | Shared table pieces: `TableShell`, `Seat`, `Lobby`, `TrumpPicker`, `GameHome`, `RoomClient`, `NameGate`. |
| `games/532/components/` | The 5-3-2 table UI: `Table`, `Hand`, `Seat`, `TrickArea`, `Overlays`, `Lobby`, the landing page and rules. |
| `components/ui/` | Shared building blocks every game uses: `GameLanding`, `Panel`, `Button`, `TextField`, `RulesDialog`, `StatusScreen`... |
| `components/cards/` | `PlayingCard` and suit icons, shared by all games. |
| `components/hub/` | The hub landing page and game tiles. |
| `lib/cards/`, `lib/hooks/` | Game-agnostic card types and helpers, and shared React hooks. |

## Multiplayer design

The socket service is a plain broadcast relay: it has no game logic, no authentication, and every message reaches everyone in the room. So:

- **The host's browser is the game server.** It runs the game's engine (`games/<slug>/game/engine.ts`), holds the only copy of the full state (including the undealt cards), and validates every action: whose turn it is, follow-suit, trump, exchanges. Guests only send intents (`play`, `trump`, `give`, `ready`) and render the view they receive.
- **Hands are private.** Each guest and the host agree a key with ECDH (P-256) and every message that carries a view or an action is sealed with AES-GCM. Anyone else in the room, including someone who guesses the room code, sees only ciphertext. A forged action fails to decrypt, so it can't impersonate a player. The first host a guest hears from is pinned for that session.
- **Random draws** for exchanges use `crypto.getRandomValues` on the host; the drawn card is revealed only to the player who earned the exchange.
- **Disconnects.** The host watches the room's `status` events. If a seated player drops mid-game the table pauses; they rejoin by reopening the link (same tab keeps the seat, a new tab can take over a vacant one). Before the game starts a departing player simply frees their seat. If the host drops, guests see a banner and the game resumes when the host reloads (the host's table state is kept in `sessionStorage`). "Leave" by the host ends the table for everyone.
- Guests ask the host for the current view every 5 seconds, so a dropped message can't leave anyone stuck.

### Limits worth knowing

- Because the host runs the game, a determined host could read the full state in their own browser. Players have to trust the host the way they would trust whoever deals at a real table.
- Identity is per browser tab (`sessionStorage`); there are no accounts.
- The socket service only accepts the origins listed in the SOP (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, `https://coffeecoders.cc`).
- Connection settings default to the values in the SOP and can be overridden with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_PATH`.
